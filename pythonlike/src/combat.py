def attack(attacker, defender, method, entities):
    # Choose handler by method (maybe not needed?)

    # Calculate values (use sigmoid for probability)
    # Hit chance = (base accuracy * weapon modifier) / size modifier
    # Bypass armor chance = (base accuracy * weapon modifier) / armor rating (chance to hit armor)
    # Damage = (base damage * weapon modifier) / base resistance (for each damage type if hit)
    # Damage on armor = (base damage * weapon modifier) / (base resistance + armor resistance) (for each damage type if hit)

    # Calculate result from values

    # Check if target died

    # Construct message

    pass

# Should we have a class for combat results?
