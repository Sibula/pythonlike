To install use ```pipenv install```. You may need to download Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable if you don't have it.

To run use ```pipenv shell```, navigate into the src folder, and run ```python main.py```

Alternatively you can use ```pipenv install --system``` to install the packages using pip instead of pipenv and run the game outside a virtual environment.
